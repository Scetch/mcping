`mcping` is a Rust crate that provides Minecraft server ping protocol implementations. It can be used to ping servers and collect information such as the MOTD, max player count, online player sample, server icon, etc.

The library supports both Java and Bedrock servers, and has comprehensive DNS handling (such as SRV record lookup).

## Example

Ping a Java Server with no timeout:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;

let (latency, response) = mcping::get_status(mcping::Java {
    server_address: "mc.hypixel.net".into(),
    timeout: None,
})?;
```

Ping a Bedrock server with no timeout, trying 3 times:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;

let (latency, response) = mcping::get_status(mcping::Bedrock {
    server_address: "mc.hypixel.net".into(),
    timeout: None,
    tries: 3,
    ..Default::default()
})?;
```

A more complete example can be found in the `cli` example (`examples/cli.rs`) and can be run with `cargo run --example cli`. Some example invocations:

```
cargo run --example cli -- --edition java mc.hypixel.net
cargo run --example cli -- --edition bedrock play.nethergames.org
```
